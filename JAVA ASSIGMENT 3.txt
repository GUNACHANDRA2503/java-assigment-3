Question 1

Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, author name,
and reading status) of the following books.


var library = [ 
    {
        title: 'Bill Gates',
        author: 'The Road Ahead',
        readingStatus: true
    },
    {
        title: 'Steve Jobs',
        author: 'Walter Isaacson',
        readingStatus: true
    },
    {
        title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
        author: 'Suzanne Collins',
        readingStatus: false
    }];

for (var i = 0; i < library.length; i++) 
   {
    var book = "'" + library[i].title + "'" + ' by ' + library[i].author + ".";
    if (library[i].readingStatus) {
      console.log("Already read " + book);
    } else
    {
     console.log("You still need to read " + book);
    }
   }

The output should look like this:

Already read 'Bill Gates' by The Road Ahead.
Already read 'Steve Jobs' by Walter Isaacson.
You still need to read 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games' by Suzanne
Collins.

below 18 years old, if driver age is greater than or equal to 18, it generates an alert "Drive safe".
